📝 Vue Task Management App (Built with Vite)

A simple yet dynamic task management web application built using Vue 3 + Vite. This project demonstrates core Vue concepts such as component-based architecture, reactive state management, event-driven communication, and dynamic rendering.

🔧 Key Features

Task Creation & Form Handling – Users can add new tasks using reactive form inputs with basic validation and reset logic.

Dynamic Rendering – Tasks are displayed using Vue’s list and conditional rendering features for real-time updates.

Component Communication – Child components emit custom events to update state in the parent without mutating props (best practice).

State Management – Uses reactive arrays and computed properties to track completed and pending tasks.

Filtering & Sorting – Tasks can be filtered (e.g., All, Todo, Done) using computed state.

Smooth UX Enhancements – CSS class bindings and Vue’s <TransitionGroup> add interactive animations when tasks are added or removed.

Scoped Styling – Each component has its own style for better maintainability.

Dev Tools Integration – Debugged and tested using Vue DevTools for reactive state visualization.

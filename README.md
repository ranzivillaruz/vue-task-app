# 📝 Vue Task Management App (Built with Vite)

A simple yet dynamic **task management web application** built using **Vue 3 + Vite**.  
This project demonstrates core Vue concepts such as **component-based architecture**, **reactive state management**, **event-driven communication**, and **dynamic rendering**.

---

## 🔧 Key Features

✅ **Task Creation & Form Handling** – Users can add new tasks using reactive form inputs with basic validation and reset logic.  
🎯 **Dynamic Rendering** – Tasks are displayed using Vue’s list and conditional rendering for real-time updates.  
🔁 **Component Communication** – Child components emit custom events to update parent state (without mutating props).  
📊 **State Management** – Uses reactive arrays and computed properties to track completed and pending tasks.  
🧩 **Filtering & Sorting** – Tasks can be filtered by type (All, Todo, Done) using computed state.  
✨ **Smooth UX Enhancements** – CSS class bindings and Vue’s `<TransitionGroup>` add animations for adding/removing tasks.  
🎨 **Scoped Styling** – Each component has its own scoped CSS for better maintainability.  
🧠 **Dev Tools Integration** – Debugged and tested using **Vue DevTools** for real-time state visualization.
